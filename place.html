        <p class="brieftext"> just like everytime i need to make a decision, i struggled with deciding which brief to pick yet again, but this time it was much quicker to narrow it down. my goal this year is to create
          work that tells stories, through characters and environments, i wanted to build up narratives that were big and small. And while i like the idea of exploring memories and the inner self as 
          a physical place, I was far more interested in the ficional world building clause in Brief D! I already had a bunch of ideas for fictional worlds; with both fantasy and sci fi ideas 
          but i first wanted to think of a general theme for this story and world, what makes this world interesting? why does it exist, and why specifically in the state it would be in while i 
          told its story. and i decided for the purpose of wanted to create social change, i wanted to tell a story about rebellion through the environment of a world and how fighting back can create 
          change. Especially against systems in out current society that work against the best interest of the majority of people, such as capitalism.

        <p class="brieftext">I knew at some point this year i wanted to create a project around a video game, and so initially i did research for this project around a game, two to be specific, bomb rush cyberfunk
          and Just Set Radio. 2 Games about being rebellious troublemaking delinquints that go around skateboarding and rollerskating while fighting against the system, a clear inspiration for my 
          goal with this project. i loved the games vibrant colours and funky style and if i were to go with the urban theme id want to achieve something of a similar vibe as these 2 games.

        <p class="brieftext">And here i ended up at my old friend cyberpunk, a dark gritty genre about fighting a crushing system, a dystopia with no hope where humanity and people are looked down on as miniscule
          where consumerism is rampant and the elite pull all the strings. a true nightmare. i thought of creating my story through this lens of cyberpunk, it stood for all the things i was trying 
          to fight against, and so creating a cyberpunk society only to tear it down sounded fun. But i had a pressing concern; dystopias are everywhere, and for good reason, the future feels uncertain
          and frankly doomed, and so dystopias can act as comofort that we havent reached that point yet, but in a book i read, the author mentioned how "dystopia is not some far away future, its here, its now"
          and dystopia's negative outlook on the future can spur conversation, but why couldnt positive work do that? well it can! and so i wanted to instead flip this story and create a utopian world
          specifically a solarpunk world! one that thrives and strives for inclusivity, social justices, and balance between nature, hamnity and technology. and so i thought of a narrative arc
          about a cyberpunk world being transformed into a solarpunk world.

        <p class="brieftext">But as i worked on this project, and the idea of a cyberpunk world turning solarpunk, i had a serious revelation, that my concept of nature reclaiming industrialised spaces could come off as greenwashing.
          greenwashing is making “unwarranted or overblown claims about sustainability or environmental friendliness” (Dhal R. 2010) this is typically a term used to describe corporations whose actions to be more 
          sustainable are purely performative. Similarly, I here use it to describe the way in which I tried to show abandoned buildings being overtaken by nature as a good thing.
          While nature permeating abandoned constructs isn’t a bad thing, (opposed to them being derelict and dead areas) that wasn’t my intention, my intention was people deliberately making changes to better the
          environment and society, Simply adding on some plants on what were meant to be monuments dedicated to the flaws of society wouldn’t properly articulate the world I envisioned so I decided to remove that 
          aspect after realising it was greenwashing. and moving forward i would only focus on creating a utopian world. specifically i wanted to create environment art that could be used in the background
          of an animation or game, as well as posters for this solarpunk world, hinting at a story.

        <p class="brieftext">rough sketches to visualise how the environemnt would interact with characters</p>
        <p class="brieftext">In the end, while this wasnt as successful of an outcome i wouldve hoped for, i think i learnt a lot about desinging environments for story telling. the style isnt one that immediatly 
          "gels" well with being a background due to its painterly style, and i got very bogged down in details, overworking my pieces too; causing the supporting posters to be more successful pieces 
          of work, but thats more likely to be because i have experience with that type of work, while im still learning the intricacies of environemnt design.
